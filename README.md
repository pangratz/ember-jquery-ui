* This project is based on the excellent work by [Luke Melia](https://github.com/lukemelia) on the [jquery-ui-ember](https://github.com/lukemelia/jquery-ui-ember) repository.

* This project's layout is based on the fabulous [interline/ember-skelton](https://github.com/interline/ember-skeleton)


Usage
-----

The widgets are located in [app/lib/ember-jquery-ui.js](https://github.com/pangratz/ember-jquery-ui/blob/master/app/lib/ember-jquery-ui.js). Include this file along with jQuery UI JavaScript and CSS and you're good to go.

A basic example is hosted at [http://pangratz.github.com/ember-jquery-ui](http://pangratz.github.com/ember-jquery-ui).
